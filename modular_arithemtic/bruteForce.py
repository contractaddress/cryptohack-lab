In other words, xx is a quadratic residue when it is possible to take the square root of xx modulo an integer pp.

In the below list there are two non-quadratic residues and one quadratic residue.

Find the quadratic residue and then calculate its square root. Of the two possible roots, submit the smaller one as the flag.
